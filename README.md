## Planning & developmnet

### Project Goals

My primary goal with FLowFocus was to cfreate a user-friendly and effective everyday planner, that could help users to organize their tasks ans enhance their productivity. One goal was to provide a solution that encourage self-care, task proritization and goal setting for users to ease their everyday stress.

### User-Centered Approach

The user is placed in the center of the development process, to make sure that the end result would be a userfriendly and user proritized website.

#### As a General user

-FlowFocus is for anyone that is looking for a way to get more organzed in their everyday life.

#### As a Student

- With FlowFocus you can get your tasks in order, and have a clear overview of everything that needs to be done, homework, assigments or small goals that you need to do before the big sumbmission date that's up ahead.

#### As a Business Owner

- FlowFocus can help you to manage your daily tasks and other responsibilities that comes with owning a business. With this app, you could keep you head clear and focus on the task your doing right now, and once your done, mark the task that's done, and move on to the next thing on your to do list.

#### As a New User

- If your new to FLowFocus, you'll discover a welcoming and easy navigated interface. The app is designed with the mind of "Less is more", to make sure that nothing easily could distract the user.

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes for the website by using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created one wireframe for mobile, tablet and desktop on each page of the website.

#### **Home page**

- [Wireframes for mobile]()
- [Wireframes for tablet]()

### Colors

- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for making a color palette for the website. The color are called : #102E4A
  #55C1FF
  #5887FF
  #715AFF
  #A682FF

- ![Color palette](./docs/screenshots/color-palette.png)

I used [Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/) to find different tints and shades of the colors from the original color palette. The shades used on this site were: #1A0066
#002EA3
#500AFF

- ![Shades](./docs/screenshots/tint-shades-palette.png)

I used [Color Contrast Shecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to make sure I used colors that had good contrast to eachother.

- ![Color Contrast](./docs/screenshots/color-contrast-checker.png)

I used [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) to make the gradient background for the page.

- ![CSS Gradient](./docs/screenshots/cssgradient-for-background.png)

### Fonts

- I used a font called Inter as a base for the page. This is the font used on the subheading on the logo, the heading for the slider and on the text on the page.
- For the logo, date, slides headings and the text on the to do inputs I used a font called Kalam. This to get add some dimention for the webpage, without making it overwhelming.

### Design Philosophy/ Features

- **Header**: A responsive navigation bar,

- ![Header Tablet](./docs/screenshots/header-tablet.png)
- ![Header Mobile](./docs/screenshots/header-mobile.png)

- **Slider**: A responsive slider section.

### Future Features

Future features for the webpage are:

- A footer with links to social media.
- Being able to mark todo'd as important.
- A way to get reminders of todo's the user mark as important.
- Add audio for button clicks.
- Make heading and subheading gradient in color.
- A function to share lists with others.

## Testing

- Throughout the whole development of the webpage, I've made tests in:

### DevTools

- Troughout the development I've used Devtools to inspect and test the website to be able to make the best I could for it.

### Lighthouse

- ![Lighthouse test Mobile](./docs/testing/lighthouse-test-mobile.png)

#### Issues

- I hade some issues with a section that was missing a heading, and I got a warning in w3c Validator. So I changed the section to a div, in order to get rid of the warning, because I did'nt want to put a heading there.

#### Results

- W3c validator for HTML tests.

### Manual testing
I tested the website manualy throughout the whole developing progress. The website is tested in Safari, Google Chrome and Brave. The website is also tested from an Iphone.

## Deployment

I deployed early to be able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the [repository]() and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under [Deplyments]().
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.
