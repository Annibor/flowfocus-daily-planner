## Planning & developmnet

### Project Goals

### User-Centered Approach

### Colors

- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for making a color palette for the website.

I used [Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/) to find different tints and shades of the colors from the original color palette.

I used [Color Contrast Shecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to make sure I used colors that had good contrast to eachother.

## Deployment

I deployed early to ba able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the [repository]() and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under [Deplyments]().
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.
