## Planning & developmnet

### Project Goals

My primary goal with FLowFocus was to cfreate a user-friendly and effective everyday planner, that could help users to organize their tasks ans enhance their productivity. One goal was to provide a solution that encourage self-care, task proritization and goal setting for users to ease their everyday stress.

### User-Centered Approach

The user is placed in the center of the development process, to make sure that the end result would be a userfriendly and user proritized website.

#### As a General user

-FlowFocus is for anyone that is looking for a way to get more organzed in their everyday life.

#### As a Student

- With FlowFocus you can get your tasks in order, and have a clear overview of everything that needs to be done, homework, assigments or small goals that you need to do before the big sumbmission date that's up ahead.

#### As a New User

- If your new to FLowFocus, you'll discover a welcoming and easy navigated interface. The app is designed with the mind of "Less is more", to make sure that nothing easily could distract the user.

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes for the website by using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created one wireframe for mobile, tablet and desktop on each page of the website.

#### **Home page**

### Colors

- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for making a color palette for the website.

I used [Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/) to find different tints and shades of the colors from the original color palette.

I used [Color Contrast Shecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) to make sure I used colors that had good contrast to eachother.

## Deployment

I deployed early to ba able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the [repository]() and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under [Deplyments]().
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.
